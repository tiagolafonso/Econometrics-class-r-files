## Serial Correlation Exercises

### Eviews

1.  estimate the model:

*l**c**o**n**s*<sub>*t*</sub> = *β*<sub>0</sub> + *β*<sub>1</sub>*l**p**r**i**ce*<sub>*t*</sub> + *β*<sub>2</sub>*l**d**i**s**p*<sub>*t*</sub> + *u*<sub>*t*</sub>

1.  Obtain the residuals and plot them against time. Do you see any
    pattern?

2.  Plot *u*<sub>*t*</sub> against *u*<sub>*t* − 1</sub>. Do you see any
    pattern? What does it suggest?

3.  Perform the Breusch-Godfrey test for serial correlation. Clearly
    state the null hypothesis (*H*<sub>0</sub>) and the alternative
    hypothesis (*H*<sub>1</sub>). Report the relevant test statistic and
    the associated p-value. Based on this result, what do you conclude
    about the presence of serial correlation?

4.  Check for heteroskedasticity in the original model. Use a proper
    test and explain your results.

5.  Estimate the model using HAC standard errors. Discuss any important
    differences with the usual standard errors.
