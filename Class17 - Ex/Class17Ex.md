## Questions - `Eviews`

**a)** Estimate the regression:  

$$
\textcolor{purple}{gdp = \beta_0 + \beta_1 gfcf + \beta_2 exports + u}
$$  

What is the effect of exports on gdp?  


**b)** Considering the previous regression, check for multicollinearity without using the VIF test.  

**c)** Estimate the regression in (a) with per capita values. Are there changes? Point out the best model. Explain in detail.  

**d)** Check the desirable econometric properties in regression (c).  

**e)** Check for heteroscedasticity of the errors in regression (a).  

**f)** Check the model specification in (a).  

**g)** Check the normality of the residuals in (a). If there is no normality of residuals, point out the reason.  

**h)** Estimate the regression:  

$$
\textcolor{purple}{gdp = \beta_0 + \beta_1 gfcf + \beta_2 trade + u}
$$  

Does $\beta_2$ have the expected effect?  

**i)** Check the stability of the coefficients in (h).  

**j)** Is there any relevant information missing from the model in (h)?  

**k)** Check if there are any missing variables in the model of (h).  

**l)** Check if there are redundant variables in the model of (h).  

**m)** Check for conditional heteroscedasticity in (h). If so, identify the order.  

**n)** Did the 2008 financial crisis in Greece have any effect on the German economy?  

**o)** Estimate the regression in (h) with Generalized Least Squares. What happened?
