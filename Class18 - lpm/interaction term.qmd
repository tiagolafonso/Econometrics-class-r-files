# Interaction term

$$
Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1X_{i1}+\beta_2X_{i2}+\beta_3(X_{i1}*X_{i2})+\mu_i
$$

$\beta_1$ is the effect of $X_1$ in $Y$, when $X_2$ is zero

$\beta_2$ is the effect of $X_2$ in $Y$, when $X_1$ is zero

$\beta_3$ is the change in the effect of $X_1$ on $Y$ for each additional unit of $X_2$ and vice-versa.
